# TensorFlow intro
Exercises from https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud187 lectures on Deep Learning and TensorFlow

## Structure

The project structure isn't the best, as multiple folders with content from different lessons appear. Each lesson folder contains a notebook replicating the lesson's contents and and a "local" directory where functions and classes used to achieve the lesson's goals are defined. Such functions and classes may or may not be similar/the same between different lessons, but I chose to have each lesson have its own "local" directory.
